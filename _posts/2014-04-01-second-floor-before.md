Our most ambitious plans at this point are for the second floor. Here are a bunch of photos of it as it is now.

## Landing "Bedroom"

<figcaption>This is the view from the top of the stairs, my favorite parts are these "super useful" closets.</figcaption>

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/landing-5.jpg" alt="landing-5" />
<figcaption>Some details here, like the halfway done ceiling drywall and the old school heating grates.</figcaption>

## Master Bedroom

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/master-2.jpg" alt="master-2" />
<figcaption>The master was modified to match the shape of the front of the house, making it octagonal.</figcaption>

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/master-4.jpg" alt="master-4" />
<figcaption>Here's the other "closet" and this weird wall-mounted light socket.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Normal Bedroom

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/bedroom-3.jpg" alt="bedroom-3" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/bedroom-4.jpg" alt="bedroom-4" />
<figcaption>Not much to see here, some dark green walls and unfinished painting/trim work.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class="third">
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/bedroom-5.jpg" alt="bedroom-5" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/bedroom-7.jpg" alt="bedroom-7" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/bedroom-6.jpg" alt="bedroom-6" />
<figcaption>This room has the only real closet of the three. The ladder is still in there from when we inspected the attic.</figcaption>
</figure>

I also made this quick video, to give a better idea.

## Blueprints - Before

<figcaption>This is the blueprint I made of the floor, using various iOS and OSX apps.</figcaption>

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/second-floor/blueprints/before-4.png" alt="before-4" />
<figcaption>And their associated 3D views.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Blueprints - After

Our plan for now, subject to change of course, is to add a bathroom as follows:

* Split small bedroom to make room for the bath

* Arrange bathroom wall to avoid any window modification, eliminating the need to modify the siding

* Bath will have a shower stall

* Remove the French doors to the Master

* Add a wall separating the landing bedroom from the stairs

* Eliminate both triangle closets

* Add closets roughly 36"x24" for both small rooms

* Add a closet roughly 60"x24" for the master
