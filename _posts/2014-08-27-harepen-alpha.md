The house project is on hold while some infrastructure is setup at my parent's [farm](http://patchworkfamilyfarm.com). To that end, I'm applying my skills to various projects over there. This is one of them, a mobile pen for rabbits, where they can graze without escaping or tearing up the lawn/pasture, and with a sheltered area for nesting.

The overall design is triangular, so I started with the triangle frame pieces. We have a pile of these 2x2s about 36 inches long so I used that size as a baseline. It took a fair amount of trial and error to get the angles exactly how I wanted them, with flat edges and clean joints. The first image is the two small test pieces I made to test the top corner, which is on the right. The full size pieces match these angles, but are longer.

I cut enough pieces for four of these triangles, using a template piece to match the length and angles of all four, then attached the ends with 3 inch screws.

For the beams that connect the triangles, I decided to get fancy and match the angles. I created this template and attached it to the end of a 2x6, then ripped it down for the top and two bottom pieces of each section.

I attached these to the triangles with a nailgun, then attached the sections together with more nailgun nails.

I got most of the way through building the shelter box when two things happened. I started to run out of daylight, and I realized my harepen design would probably stand up to being moved one or two times before falling apart.

Don't worry, the beta version is considerably more structurally sound.
