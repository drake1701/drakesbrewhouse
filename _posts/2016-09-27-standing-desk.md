I've fallen way behind in updating this site, but things are finally starting to move forward on the house. I'm planning to get some more photos and get a post up in the next week or so with details there, but in the meantime here's a project from last year.

I decided to use some scrap wood my brother brought from work and some salvaged boards from a friend's barn to make a standing desk.

I bought and use a Kregâ„¢ jig to assemble everything with wood screws, which was fortunate because the desk ended up being about 1.5 inches too short for comfort and I was able to disassemble and extend the legs at the top.

The top is screwed from the bottom, so even though imperfections and old nail holes are still visible, the actual fasteners are all hidden.

I also made a removeable bottom shelf, where I keep plastic boxes with office supplies, and keeps my windows computer off the floor.

Finally, the completed product before staining and finishing the wood, and the first iteration being used.

I also built a shelf to support my monitor and macbook, but after a few months decided it needed to be bigger, as I'm now using two monitors and keeping the macbook closed. Here's a photo of the desk today, with all the various crap my desks always seem to accumulate.

You can also get just a slight idea of the bias lighting I recently installed on the backs of my monitors. The lamp will move at some point.
