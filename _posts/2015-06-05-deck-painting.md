A few weeks ago I finally got around to power-washing the dangerous slime off my back deck, and discovered I liked the bare wood and leftover paint even less. I took a belt sander to the remaining paint and gave the whole thing a coat of deck "stain"

The jury's still out on whether it needs a second coat, but it probably does.
