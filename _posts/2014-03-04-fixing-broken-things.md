After spending last weekend acquiring the missing kitchen appliances, (Woo Craigslist) we turned on the water from the street to see if there are any plumbling issues.

There are.

The line of PVC running from the water softener is split down the side, and sprays water everywhere. Hopefully this is the only plumbing issue, but I doubt it. Too much pressure is being lost to get flow anywhere else, so we'll see.

Update {{ "2014-03-05" | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}: The source lines are rebuilt, and there's no other source line leakage that we know of. There are some drain leaks, but those just need to be reassembled with pvc primer and we'll be good to go.
